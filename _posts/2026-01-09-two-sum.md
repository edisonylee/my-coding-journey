## Problem

[Two Sum]({{ page.leetcode_url }}) - **{{ page.difficulty | capitalize }}**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

**Constraints:**
- 2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
- Each input has exactly one solution
- Cannot use the same element twice

## Approach

The naive approach is to use nested loops to check every pair (O(n²)), but we can do better with a hash map.

**Key insight:** For each number, we can calculate its complement (target - num) and check if we've seen it before. By storing numbers we've seen in a hash map with their indices, we can do this check in O(1) time.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create an empty hash map to store {number: index}
2. Iterate through the array
3. For each number, calculate complement = target - num
4. If complement exists in hash map, we found our answer
5. Otherwise, store current number and index in hash map

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - hash map stores up to n elements

## Solution

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Trading space for time**: Using O(n) extra space to reduce time from O(n²) to O(n)
- **Complement pattern**: Very common in array problems - looking for pairs that satisfy a condition
- **Hash maps for O(1) lookups**: Essential data structure for optimizing search operations
- **One-pass solution**: Don't need to store all elements first; can check as we go
