## Last First Day of Class

Hey! Today's my last first day of class—my final semester before graduating in May. I figured I'd post a long and genuine update.

It's been about a week since I took the dive and committed to becoming a software engineer. For starters, I was previously product-oriented. I thought product was what I wanted to do and that coding itself would be filtered out and have less relevance in the future. But as I kept wanting to build my startup and company, I realized the easiest way to do this was to become extremely technical and dig deep.

Beyond that, I also started genuinely enjoying coding and truly understanding systems. In the past, I've built, tested, developed, and even deployed software—but to me it all felt really surface-level, at least my passion for it. Now, I'm earnestly doing deep dives and spending around 6-8 hours daily learning how to code, practicing DSA via LeetCode, creating projects, etc.

## What I Did This Week

**Python Fundamentals** (~5 hours)
- Touched up my Python fundamentals and reinforced core concepts

**LeetCode** (~20 hours)
- Primarily covered arrays and two pointers
- Solved problems including:
  - Valid Anagram (LC #242)
  - Group Anagrams (LC #49)
  - Top K Frequent Elements (LC #347)
  - Valid Sudoku (LC #36)
  - Longest Consecutive Sequence (LC #128)
  - Valid Palindrome (LC #125)
  - Two Sum II (LC #167)

**Startup Project** (~30 hours)
- Working on a deeply technical project for a startup
- Building a microservice using Rust—it's been going over my head, but I'm learning
- Spent most of the time prompting Claude and trying to understand as much as possible
- Goal: ship it as soon as possible while deeply understanding the architecture

**Community Building** (~5 hours)
- Scrolling X and LinkedIn for inspiration and developer tools
- Yes, it was mindless scrolling, but I don't think it was a waste of time—it makes you feel like you're part of a community
- In reality, everyone in tech doesn't realize how small of a bubble we're in

## Current Situation

I'm currently sustaining myself with two part-time jobs:
- **Website & Content Manager** for the School of Physics (10 hours/week)
- **Growth Marketing Ambassador** for Celsius (25 hours/week)

I'm actively searching for a full-time software engineering position at a company with:
- Brand recognition
- Insane learning opportunities
- The right environment for me to grow

I need to learn as much as possible and find where I truly fit.

## Reflection

I'm seriously enjoying this more technical side. Honestly, I wish I could cover all aspects: front-end, back-end, UI/UX design (I have some artistic ability), and even the marketing/sales side. Maybe AI will let me do this in the future.

## Interesting Proposal

There's a startup competition at my school with a deadline of 2/1. Prize: $150k in funding. I want to participate and am currently looking for teammates.

## Next Steps

- Continue grinding LeetCode (moving into stacks and sliding window)
- Finish the Rust microservice project
- Find teammates for the startup competition
- Keep applying to full-time SWE roles

Until the next update,

Edison
