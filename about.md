## About Me

Hi, I'm **Edison Lee**.

This blog is my public learning journal where I document my coding journey. Every day, I:

- Work on **LeetCode** problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills
- Learn **Python** concepts and best practices
- Build **projects** to apply what I've learned
- Track my progress to stay accountable

## Why I'm Doing This

Learning in public keeps me motivated and accountable. By documenting my progress, I can:

- See how far I've come
- Help others who are on a similar journey
- Build a portfolio of my learning
- Develop consistent coding habits

## Tools & Tech

- **Platform**: GitHub Pages + Jekyll
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, and more
- **Focus Areas**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Web Development
